1. Argument passing. Every program will page fault until arg
  passing is implemented.

  In setup_stack(), we can change *esp = PHYS_BASE - 12; to 
  prevent errors initially.


2. User memory access - All system calls need to ready user memory,
    a few need to write to uesr memory.

3. System call infrastructure. Implement enough code to read the system
    call number from the user stack and dispatch to a handler based on it.

4. exit() system call.

5. write() system call.

6. process_wait() - turn into an infinite loop. We'll eventually need
                    to provide correct implementation.
